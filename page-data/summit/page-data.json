We're gathering builders, architects,\nvisionaries, ethicists, and policy-makers for one day of facilitated\nconversation and planning. Our goal is to find—and create—ways to concretely\nsupport each other's work, through multidisciplinary interproject collaboration.\nWe are especially interested in projects that enable decentralized social,\nstorage, and identity.\n\nThis event is a facilitated conversation, not a conference. It's styled as an\nAspiration \"Unconference [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference]\". There\nwon't be any keynotes, panels, or sponsored content. It's just you and your\npeers talking directly to each other in structured sessions about the topics you\ndecide are important on those days. Some of the issues we hope to cover include:\n\n * Trade-offs between self-sovereign, federated, and centralized approaches\n * Structuring incentives to foster an open ecosystem\n * How do we put this stuff in everybody's hands?\n * Shaping a more ethical, private, and secure next wave of infrastructure\n\nWhat sets this event apart is our approach to finding solutions. We're not\nlooking at problems solely through a technology lens. We're building a coalition\nthat reflects all parts of society—artists, academics, entrepreneurs, public\nservants, policy makers, journalists, and more—people who feel this is the time\nfor change. Tech for the common good must be built by the people who will\nultimately benefit from it.\n\nIf you're actively working on decentralizing social, identity, storage, or\nrelated efforts, or more focused on policy, ethics, and social impact, we hope\nyou can join us! Contact olivia@dsnp.org for more details. And if you know\npeople and projects you would like to see in the room, please let us know so we\ncan invite them too.\n\nThe Summit immediately precedes Unfinished Live [https://live.unfinished.com], a\nconference whose theme is \"The Future Is Decentralized\". Summit participants\nwill each receive a complimentary ticket to Live. We will continue the\nconversation and provide opportunities for more working sessions there.\n\nFor Covid-19 precautions, this event will require masks indoors and instant\ntesting at the start of the day. We are mindful that there are uncertainties\nsurrounding present and future Covid-19 trends, and we are actively tracking\nrelevant indicators and policies. We ask that all our participants be fully\nvaccinated. If you won't be fully vaccinated by then, we look forward to hosting\nyou at our next event.\n\nWhile this event is in-person only, we're planning virtual gatherings in the\nnear future, so let us know if you're interested in an event like this but would\nprefer virtual attendance.","html":"<p><em>22 September 2021, 9am-6pm, at <a href=\"https://theglasshouses.com/glasshouse-chelsea/\">Glasshouse Chelsea</a> in New York City</em></p><p>Decentralized infrastructure promises a more equitable and human-oriented online world—if we can make it compelling for people to use and make it work at scale.
