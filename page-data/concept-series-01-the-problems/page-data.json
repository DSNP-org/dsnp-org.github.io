Up\nfirst? A look back at the problems we’ve encountered and how our needs were\nmismatched with what was available.\n\nIn 2020, we released the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP)\nWhitepaper [https://github.com/LibertyDSNP/papers]. Since then we have been\nworking to make that protocol a reality. We started with a proof of concept on\nEthereum with version 1.0 of the specification. Although Ethereum has issues\nsuch as cost and possible transactions per second (TPS), it is a great ecosystem\nof developers, knowledge, and tools. We used Ethereum as a testing ground\nknowing that we would need to move to a different chain eventually.\n\nAlong the way we refined the ideas from the whitepaper and tried to focus on the\nreality of what is possible. Several times we questioned the core reasons we\nwanted to use the blockchain in the first place. Each time finding alignment in\nour principle of having the users control their own data and identity. Users\nshould be the ultimate power holders in this new ecosystem.\n\nIn addition to being the shiny new toy in the bin, blockchains provide real\nvalue through a system enabling user ownership, choice, provider cooperation,\nand collaboration in ways previously difficult or impossible. Achieving user\nownership in technology has historically required highly technical\nparticipation, if allowed at all. Anyone can, in theory, physically run a\nserver, but in practice that means technically inclined individuals of means. We\nwant to follow the trend of expanding participation and access, not reverse it.\nBlockchains provide a foundation for ownership without the need for equipment.\n\nOwnership and Choice\n\nOwnership is fundamentally about the ability to choose. Choose who you want to\ninteract with and who you trust. When users are the product and only have the\npower to leave at the cost of forfeiting all they have built on a platform—trust\nis replaced with lock-in. Blockchain elevates and expands the options for\nparticipation in how the network functions and provides for innovation beyond\nwalled off APIs. In addition, we gain benefits from the systems of cryptography,\ndecentralization, economic incentives, and more.\n\nThese qualities encouraged us to find a blockchain that could be the foundation\nfor DSNP. We looked at dozens of chains\n[https://forums.projectliberty.io/t/chain-selection-update-jan-2022/168]. We had\nvarious evaluation criteria to try to weigh the different tradeoffs, but three\ninterconnected issues were above all the others: Low cost, scale, and\ndecentralized disinterested nodes.\n\nLow Cost\n\nLow cost is a bit of a holy grail for blockchain. Every new chain claims\nadvances in transaction price reduction. However, as the chain becomes popular\nthe transaction cost in fiat terms will skyrocket. While some of the value is\nspeculation, a portion is also due to the increasing use and recognition of the\nusefulness of blockchain. That same volatile rise in value leads to\nunpredictable costs which limit the ability for many services to build on top of\nblockchain, especially at scale. How can we convince users and services to adopt\nthe DSNP if the cost of using the protocol fluctuates from next to nothing to\ntens of dollars per chain transaction?\n\nScale\n\nScaled blockchains have been making strides with some chains passing hundreds of\nthousands of transactions per second. Yet, the scale of social media\ninteractions when you include posts, replies, reactions, direct messages, and\nmore is orders of magnitude greater. DSNP leverages a batching concept for\ncompressing the vast number of these messages from a protocol standpoint, but\nthe scale is still beyond what many blockchains are able to do in addition to\ntheir existing growth and load.\n\nDecentralized Nodes\n\nScale aside, some blockchains we looked at have reduced cost by increasing\ncentralization. While we expect chains to go through a period of centralization\nduring testing and early adoption, disinterested nodes are critical for\nmaintaining user ownership when forces collude. For DSNP to remain an open\nprotocol, decentralization of the infrastructure is key to provide guarantees\nagainst powerful bad actors. Social media is targeted by a wide variety of\nactors who desire to control the flow of information. China’s “Great Firewall”\nis the best known, but most political powers have tried with various degrees of\nsuccess to control the flow of information for good and ill. In the end,\ninfrastructure is not a moral agent and cannot not be required to make moral\nchoices. Infrastructure should enable moral decisions to be made by users,\nservice providers, and democratic governance. (Look for more on DSNP governance\nin a future post.)\n\nTrade-offs\n\nCost, scale, and decentralization are the largest requirements for a blockchain\nto support DSNP. We also found a secondary tier of competing trade-offs while\ninvestigating potential chains. Each blockchain comes with its unique spectrum\nof solutions to the problems facing all blockchain projects.\n\n * What is the transaction load that the chain can support?\n * What happens when the chain is under congestion?\n * How can we support shifting network costs from users to services without\n   losing user ownership?\n * What are the data storage and availability guarantees?\n * How can we support upgrades and improvements over time?\n * What are the protections against spam and network abuse?\n * Is the economic system of incentives able to support growth, contraction, and\n   steady state situations?\n * Is the development of the project secure to continue?\n * What outside incentives and pressures might the project have?\n * How hard is it for developers to onboard to build a larger ecosystem?\n\nThe Perfect Chain\n\nAs we tried to answer these questions and more, something kept bothering us. We\nfelt stuck in a blockchain version of Goldilocks and the Three Bears, except\nwith a lot more bears and no bed that matched our needs. Some chains appeared\ngreat, but then as we looked closer, the price might shoot out of our\nconstraints. Others proclaimed decentralization, but were actually dangerously\ncontrolled by a few parties.\n\nDuring the process, we realized that almost every chain we looked at was focused\non the value of each individual transaction. In DSNP, as with networking in\ngeneral, the value is not in the individual messages, but in the aggregate of a\nscaled number of messages and the possibilities of potential connections that\ncreates value.\n\nAnother realization was that our messages on DSNP have different constraints\nthan financial transactions. For DSNP, as other networking protocols like\nTCP/IP, the messages are being created not value transferred. For a new blog\npost, no balance needs to be validated before it can be created. An act of\ncreation is fundamentally different from an act of transfer.\n\nAs we understood these constraints and tradeoffs, an outline emerged of a chain\nperfectly designed for DSNP (or other protocols with similar needs) could look\nlike:\n\n * Decentralized disinterested nodes\n * Scaled messaging with origin validation\n * Predictable costs for users and services\n * Extremely low cost on a per message basis with either support for coinless\n   transactions for users or cost shifting from users to intermediary service\n   providers\n\nThe world is different from 2013 when Vitalik Buterin expanded on the ideas\nproven at scale in Bitcoin. We stand on the work of countless developers today.\nWe believe we can solve the next set of problems to build a blockchain that\nprovides scalable message passing at minimal cost. A chain that can be a\nbackbone of new shared protocols. A world that expands on the ideals of the\nInternet to create value through cooperation and user choice.","html":"<p>[Ed Note: Check out the <a href=\"https://forums.projectliberty.io/t/about-the-concept-posts-category/203\">DSNP Forum</a> to follow community discussions around this new series of short essays that describe some of the concepts behind DSNP, what we've learned as we've built out the protocol, and where we're going]<br><br>This is the first in a series of posts laying out what we have learned in the chain search and concepts that are needed to understand where we are going.
