Because the protocol is available for anyone to use, for both commercial and non-commercial purposes, our role is to help implementors ensure the integrity and decentralized governance of the unified and universally accessible social graph. The integrity of the graph includes DSNP's promises about people's privacy and control over their communications.  To serve these goals:</p><ul><li>We provide a framework for DSNP-related working groups and ongoing standards development (based loosely on the role of the IETF in Internet governance), and help participants interface with other standards bodies when needed.</li><li>We keep watch for unanticipated or adversarial centralization, and coordinate community response as needed. Decentralized systems usually have centralizing forces circulating within them, for example nodes that grow especially large and influential, and preserving true decentralization can sometimes require coordinated action.</li><li>We arrange virtual and in-person gatherings of DSNP implementors, both to help accelerate development and usage of DSNP as a technology and to ensure that there is a community of mutually familiar implementors who share a vision of DSNP's purpose.</li><li>We coordinate legal defense of DSNP if necessary (e.g., community patent defense).</li><li>We work transparently and in public as much as possible.  Anyone should be able to see what what DSNP.org is doing without necessarily being a participant.</li></ul><p>Control of content flowing over DSNP is not within the scope of DSNP.org's mission, and we do not take part in development of content filtering policy; that is for nodes in and gateways to the graph to decide and implement.  Our goal is maintenance of the protocol and the decentralized social graph in such a way that the public interest is well-served by having individuals use DSNP-based technologies to communicate.</p>","id":"Ghost__Post__610184c87c4b640001f399ec","tags":[{"name":"#HomePage"},{"name":"#HomePageMission"}],"excerpt":"The mission of DSNP.org is to support community development of open source\ntechnology and protocols to create a single, universally accessible, and\ndecentralized social graph.\n\nOur primary activity is stable and responsible stewardship of the Decentralized\nSocial Networking Protocol (DSNP).
