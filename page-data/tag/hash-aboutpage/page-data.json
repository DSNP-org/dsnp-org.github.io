Because the protocol is available for anyone to use, for both commercial and non-commercial purposes, our role is to help implementors ensure the integrity and decentralized governance of the unified and universally accessible social graph. The integrity of the graph includes DSNP's promises about people's privacy and control over their communications.  To serve these goals:</p><ul><li>We provide a framework for DSNP-related working groups and ongoing standards development (based loosely on the role of the IETF in Internet governance), and help participants interface with other standards bodies when needed.</li><li>We keep watch for unanticipated or adversarial centralization, and coordinate community response as needed. Decentralized systems usually have centralizing forces circulating within them, for example nodes that grow especially large and influential, and preserving true decentralization can sometimes require coordinated action.</li><li>We arrange virtual and in-person gatherings of DSNP implementors, both to help accelerate development and usage of DSNP as a technology and to ensure that there is a community of mutually familiar implementors who share a vision of DSNP's purpose.</li><li>We coordinate legal defense of DSNP if necessary (e.g., community patent defense).</li><li>We work transparently and in public as much as possible.  Anyone should be able to see what what DSNP.org is doing without necessarily being a participant.</li></ul><p>Control of content flowing over DSNP is not within the scope of DSNP.org's mission, and we do not take part in development of content filtering policy; that is for nodes in and gateways to the graph to decide and implement.  Our goal is maintenance of the protocol and the decentralized social graph in such a way that the public interest is well-served by having individuals use DSNP-based technologies to communicate.</p>","url":"http://ghost-cms.dsnp.org/mission-activities/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"e12eaa09-5f63-4b56-99d5-5c8fc223c58f","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"60c115482982200001275433","reading_time":1}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__60c11523298220000127542b","title":"Guiding Principles","slug":"guiding-principles","featured":false,"feature_image":null,"excerpt":"We ground our work in a fairly simple ethos.  We've tried to lay them out here.\n This articulation might change over time, but our animating principles should\nremain consistent.\n\n * Never build anything alone\n * Flexible beats prescient\n * Open wins from the bottom up\n\nOur ethos echo the Bedrock Principles of the wider Unfinished ecosystem.  We\nlook forward to the Unfinished team rolling out those bedrocks into public view.\n For now, we'll just note that we align with their grounding in connecti","custom_excerpt":null,"visibility":"public","created_at_pretty":"09 June, 2021","published_at_pretty":"09 June, 2021","updated_at_pretty":"09 June, 2021","created_at":"2021-06-09T19:23:15.000+00:00","published_at":"2021-06-09T19:23:33.000+00:00","updated_at":"2021-06-09T19:23:33.000+00:00","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"authors":[{"name":"Claire Olmstead","slug":"claire","bio":null,"profile_image":null,"twitter":null,"facebook":null,"website":null}],"primary_author":{"name":"Claire Olmstead","slug":"claire","bio":null,"profile_image":null,"twitter":null,"facebook":null,"website":null},"primary_tag":null,"tags":[{"name":"#AboutPage","slug":"hash-aboutpage","description":null,"feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"internal"},{"name":"#AboutPagePrinciples","slug":"hash-aboutpageprinciples","description":null,"feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"internal"}],"plaintext":"We ground our work in a fairly simple ethos.  We've tried to lay them out here.\n This articulation might change over time, but our animating principles should\nremain consistent.\n\n * Never build anything alone\n * Flexible beats prescient\n * Open wins from the bottom up\n\nOur ethos echo the Bedrock Principles of the wider Unfinished ecosystem.  We\nlook forward to the Unfinished team rolling out those bedrocks into public view.\n For now, we'll just note that we align with their grounding in connection,\nvision, and collaboration.","html":"<p>We ground our work in a fairly simple ethos.  We've tried to lay them out here.  This articulation might change over time, but our animating principles should remain consistent.</p><ul><li>Never build anything alone</li><li>Flexible beats prescient</li><li>Open wins from the bottom up</li></ul><p>Our ethos echo the Bedrock Principles of the wider Unfinished ecosystem.  We look forward to the Unfinished team rolling out those bedrocks into public view.  For now, we'll just note that we align with their grounding in connection, vision, and collaboration.</p>","url":"http://ghost-cms.dsnp.org/guiding-principles/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"6da46132-b1a8-4c4d-88bb-a5541747cf0c","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"60c11523298220000127542b","reading_time":0}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__60c114f32982200001275420","title":"Governance","slug":"governance","featured":false,"feature_image":null,"excerpt":"DSNP.org is governed by a Board of Directors, with the assistance of an Advisory\nCouncil.
