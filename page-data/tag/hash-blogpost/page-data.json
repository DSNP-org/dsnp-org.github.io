The applications\nthat are built on top of blockchain have high-friction, user-unfriendly\ninterfaces, requiring one to understand, in the crypto world, what a “wallet”\nis, what it means to “sign” something, and to know to back up your “keys” in a\nsafe place or else you will never get your cryptos back. What even is a\n“custodied wallet” and why should I care what kind of wallet I have?\n\nA: It doesn’t.\nEnd users don’t know how HTTP works, and they don’t need to know. Most people\ncouldn’t name even two types of internet-based protocols. They just want to use\nthe web, and we don’t blame them. It’s not their job! People shouldn’t have to\nadapt to computers; we developers need to make computers adapt to people.\n\nAt the moment, people using decentralized applications, dApps, need to know at\nleast a little bit about cryptography and cryptocurrency to know how to use them\nand use them securely. This shouldn’t be necessary. It’s not reasonable to\nexpect anyone but enthusiasts to learn these things.\n\nWhat happens when these things are too difficult or annoying to deal with?

All\nkidding aside, someone has to pay to keep the computers turned on and to build\nthe web applications. Who’s paying for all that, if the users aren’t?\n\nA: You Shouldn’t.\nOne option would be to charge people directly, but making people pay that way\nexcludes a lot of people; not just people who can’t afford it, but lots of\npeople don’t have formal payment methods with which to pay for a social network.\n\nMoney isn’t the only way to pay for things. Some platforms decided that the way\nto pay to keep their lights on – and make a killing too – is by exploiting their\nuser base. Since users aren’t directly paying for access to the platforms, the\nplatforms mine and sell user data, sell and serve people ads, which might have\nbeen okay, sort of, but then they’ve also coerced everyone to stay on their\nplatform. They’ve convinced hundreds of millions of people to join it, while\nmaking it impossible to switch to another without losing all their social and\nfamily connections, without losing access to their favorite artists, to\nteachers, to their clubs, to learn of events they care about. Now the platform\nhas isolated its users from other platforms that might treat them better, it’s\nfree to treat users almost however they want.\n\nAs a result, someone like Kim Kardashian, with 20 million followers, can’t\nafford to leave Instagram.

We said there are ways to pay for\nthings besides money. What we will never say is that you the End User ought to\nbe coerced and exploited for it. We not only think that’s not necessary, but\nit’s bad for people. If you’re doing the work of spending time curating your\nfeed, selecting your friends, following artists, organizations, publications and\ntopics you care about, and if you’re putting your eyeballs on the platforms’\npages looking at their ads, playing their games, and filling out their surveys,\nthen you certainly ought to know and be able to control who’s watching you back,\nwhat they know, and go elsewhere if you want to - for any or no reason.\n\nYou and the application developer have a relationship. Relationships should be\nopt-in and mutually agreed-upon, where neither side is coerced into keeping it.\n\nQ: How do providers fund the platform?\nWe’ve determined that:\n\n * We need a blockchain\n   [https://forums.projectliberty.io/t/concept-series-01-the-problems/193] to\n   store a minimal record of users’ presence.\n * Doing things on a blockchain costs money.\n * Users shouldn’t and often can’t pay directly for access to social networks.\n * People shouldn’t have to be proficient at cryptocurrencies or be security\n   experts.\n * People deserve to control who’s manipulating their own data and what is being\n   done with it.\n\nA: Delegation.\nThe way to shift the costs for “doing things on a blockchain” away from End\nUsers is to delegate the actions to a third party, a Delegate. That Delegate\ncould be running a social network application that you want to use. There are\nother possibilities for delegation on this network, such as content-filtering\nservices that verify other services. So a Delegate’s job is to interact with the\nblockchain on your behalf, and with your explicit permission.\n\nThe fact that the underlying technology is a blockchain shouldn’t get in your\nway, just as you shouldn’t have to figure out how your HTTPS requests are routed\nto each endpoint in order to surf the web. People’s time is valuable and we have\nmachines for that. The Delegate does that kind of lifting so you can focus on\ndoing human things, like chatting with friends, signing up for events, and\ngetting annoyed at your cousin’s excessive travel photos.\n\nDelegates must be associated with their actions on-chain so that others can\ncheck the interactions, but they can also provide services away from the\nblockchain, such as content hosting or wallet recovery. Password managers exist\nfor a reason, and we want to raise the baseline security for everyone while\nstill enabling stronger security measures for those who need or want it.\n\nMost importantly, your data belongs to you. You should be allowed to retract\npermission to that Delegate to do things for you, at any time, without losing\nyour access to the entire platform or your social connections. Having this\ncontrol means you must explicitly authorize your Delegate, and you must know up\nfront what actions they are delegating.\n\nIn short, the relationship must be mutual, trusted and transparent.\n\nWhat things do you imagine a Delegate could do for you? What sorts of companies\nwould you trust to be a delegate?

In a more technical definition, an identity is a construct\nformed by the aggregation of events from the same source. Each event or message\nis therefore source-dependent as messages without a source do not build an\nidentity.\n\nTransfers\n\nMost blockchain projects have focused on the concept of transfer. They have\nworked toward the questions around transfers: How can it be easier to transfer\nvalue from one user to another? How can these transfers be controlled\nprogrammatically? And even how can we create new unique items of value to\ntransfer to others? The advances in answers have led down a path that has\nparticular constraints.\n\nTransfer centric transactions require protecting against attacks such as the \ndouble-spend attack [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending]. A transfer\nrequires confirmation of ownership before that ownership can be transferred.\nThis means that transfer transactions must be well ordered, have a higher level\nof validation and security, and can only be processed in series or other\nguarantees against interactions with other transactions.\n\nSource-Dependent Creation\n\nSocial networking is a world not dependent on transferring value. Each piece of\nthe narrative that creates the identity is starting fresh from the source. Other\ndata in social networks may then refer to the content, but do not alter it. The\nonly requirement is that each new creation is able to be linked to the creator.\n\nScientific data, supply chain checkpoints, and more share the characteristic\nthat they need proof of who sent the message, but do not need any proof of\ntransfer. This is the idea of an audit. We can follow the trail of who said what\nwhen and discover any falsehoods. Trust, but verify.\n\nHow does that verification happen? The simplest version of source validation is\na cryptographic signature [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature].\nMathematical proof that only the holder of a private key could have signed the\nmessage. We can extend the capabilities of a signature through a secure\nblockchain state that links public keys together (our next concept post). The\nkey is that the validation be easy and quick. Fast validation allows for invalid\nsignatures and messages to be rejected quickly with no chance of being mistaken\nfor an original. Once we focus on the source validation requirement, we can\ncreate two new features not possible in a traditional blockchain transfer\ntransaction: off-chain validation and parallel processing.\n\nFeatures\n\nAny action on-chain is expensive. Each action must be performed, replicated, and\nconfirmed by consensus. The result of those actions is guaranteed with the\nhighest possible trust level available to the chain. The cost for that guarantee\nis usually high and borne by the sender of the transaction. Off-chain actions\nhave a different cost profile. The action must be done for each consumer of the\ntransaction. This shifts the cost from the creator of the transaction to the\nconsumer, from writing to reading. That shift is desirable when the primary\nvalue is in the consumption instead of the publication of the data.\n\nOur source-dependent messages don’t require a prior validation of chain state to\nexist. We can use the chain for propagation and existence of the message and\nmove the validation of the message source or creator off-chain. To make the cost\nof validation low, we use the chain to provide easy access to the necessary data\nfor validation. We get what is called in computer science a “lazy evaluation 1\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation]” of message validity. Consumers\ndesire valid messages and the low-cost means that producers of messages can\nexpect that invalid messages will be discovered.\n\nSource-dependent messages are parallelizable by default. Parallel processing of\ntransactions is often seen as a holy grail of blockchain technology due to the\npotential performance improvements. Source-dependent messages do require some\nprevious state, the ability to know they are sourced correctly, but that is a\nfar more limited need (and off-chain possible).\n\nProblems: Race Conditions and Revocation\n\nOf course, there are some race conditions\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition] (isn’t there always?). A\nsource-dependent message must be preceded by data needed to confirm the source.\nCryptographic signatures do provide us a way to confirm the source is the holder\nof a private key, but nothing beyond that. If the source is not merely a public\nkey, the identifier used must be associated with a public key before the message\ncan be tested or an invalid message would occur pending the proper association.\n\nThose familiar with signatures will already know the next problem: revocation.\nBest security practices encourage rotating keys from time to time so that if a\nprivate key is exposed, the damage can be limited. We must deal with how to\nremove a key from the identifier aka revocation of the permissions of a key to\nbe a future source of messages. Users may also need to revoke or change a\nmessage after it is created.\n\nSolving the Problems\n\nWe can solve the problems with applying a two layer approach to message\nvalidation. First, we check if the message has a valid source. This is based\nonly on data available at the time the message was sent. Because the historical\ndata doesn’t change, the result is immutable and can be cached indefinitely. A\nmessage with a valid source can never in the future be considered to have an\ninvalid source.\n\nThe second layer is more difficult because we need the ability to change the\nvalidity of messages in the future. Users, services, and others need to delete\nmessages that were unintended or where a permission was abused. In DSNP, we use \nTombstoning [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombstone_(data_store)] and \nidempotent [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence] state changes to\naccomplish. Tombstoning is a revocation of a previous announcement. It says that\nwhile that announcement did exist, you should consider it to not exist anymore.\nIdempotent state changes don’t remove a previous message, but shift the state to\na different value. Graph change announcements\n[https://spec.dsnp.org/DSNP/Types/GraphChange] shift the state of a graph\nconnection from unfollowed to followed.\n\nHowever it is done, the message or state is altered by a future message. It is a\nmuch more difficult search space as it is continuously expanding. Because some\nuse cases may desire just the immutable message, the second layer of future\nrevocation need not always be available, but it should always be considered.\nWhile computers might not, humans change their minds all the time and DSNP is a\ntool for human communication.\n\nAs we continue this series of concepts, the idea of source-dependent messages,\nthese creation focused messages, leads to more building blocks. Next in the\nseries, we explore how we can leverage the limited requirements and ability for\noff-chain validation to enable scaled batching through user delegation of trust.\n\nNext Concept Series 03: Batching Source-Dependent Messages with Delegation\n(coming soon…)","html":"<p>[Ed Note: Check out the <a href=\"https://forums.projectliberty.io/t/about-the-concept-posts-category/203\">DSNP Forum</a> to follow community discussions around this new series of short essays that describe some of the concepts behind DSNP, what we've learned as we've built out the protocol, and where we're going.]</p><p>This is the second in a series of posts laying out what we have learned in the chain search and concepts that are needed to understand where we are going.

This shifts the cost from the creator of the transaction to the consumer, from writing to reading. That shift is desirable when the primary value is in the consumption instead of the publication of the data.</p><p>Our source-dependent messages don’t require a prior validation of chain state to exist. We can use the chain for propagation and existence of the message and move the validation of the message source or creator off-chain. To make the cost of validation low, we use the chain to provide easy access to the necessary data for validation. We get what is called in computer science a “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">lazy evaluation 1</a>” of message validity. Consumers desire valid messages and the low-cost means that producers of messages can expect that invalid messages will be discovered.</p><p>Source-dependent messages are parallelizable by default. Parallel processing of transactions is often seen as a holy grail of blockchain technology due to the potential performance improvements. Source-dependent messages do require some previous state, the ability to know they are sourced correctly, but that is a far more limited need (and off-chain possible).</p><p><strong>Problems: Race Conditions and Revocation</strong></p><p>Of course, there are some <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">race conditions</a> (isn’t there always?). A source-dependent message must be preceded by data needed to confirm the source. Cryptographic signatures do provide us a way to confirm the source is the holder of a private key, but nothing beyond that. If the source is not merely a public key, the identifier used must be associated with a public key before the message can be tested or an invalid message would occur pending the proper association.</p><p>Those familiar with signatures will already know the next problem: revocation. Best security practices encourage rotating keys from time to time so that if a private key is exposed, the damage can be limited. We must deal with how to remove a key from the identifier aka revocation of the permissions of a key to be a future source of messages. Users may also need to revoke or change a message after it is created.</p><p><strong>Solving the Problems</strong></p><p>We can solve the problems with applying a two layer approach to message validation. First, we check if the message has a valid source. This is based only on data available at the time the message was sent. Because the historical data doesn’t change, the result is immutable and can be cached indefinitely. A message with a valid source can never in the future be considered to have an invalid source.</p><p>The second layer is more difficult because we need the ability to change the validity of messages in the future. Users, services, and others need to delete messages that were unintended or where a permission was abused. In DSNP, we use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombstone_(data_store)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Tombstoning</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">idempotent</a> state changes to accomplish. Tombstoning is a revocation of a previous announcement. It says that while that announcement did exist, you should consider it to not exist anymore. Idempotent state changes don’t remove a previous message, but shift the state to a different value. <a href=\"https://spec.dsnp.org/DSNP/Types/GraphChange\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Graph change announcements</a> shift the state of a graph connection from unfollowed to followed.</p><p>However it is done, the message or state is altered by a future message. It is a much more difficult search space as it is continuously expanding. Because some use cases may desire just the immutable message, the second layer of future revocation need not always be available, but it should always be considered. While computers might not, humans change their minds all the time and DSNP is a tool for human communication.</p><p>As we continue this series of concepts, the idea of source-dependent messages, these creation focused messages, leads to more building blocks. Next in the series, we explore how we can leverage the limited requirements and ability for off-chain validation to enable scaled batching through user delegation of trust.</p><p>Next Concept Series 03: Batching Source-Dependent Messages with Delegation (coming soon…)</p>","url":"https://ghost-cms.dsnp.org/untitled/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"b2bf8899-2cda-40df-8a5f-c51d2e1c1b4b","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"62684fcedcd6a1000166d4c9","reading_time":4}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__62684e3bdcd6a1000166d49e","title":"Concept Series 01: The Problems","slug":"concept-series-01-the-problems","featured":false,"feature_image":null,"excerpt":"[Ed Note: Check out the DSNP Forum\n[https://forums.projectliberty.io/t/about-the-concept-posts-category/203] to\nfollow community discussions around this new series of short essays that\ndescribe some of the concepts behind DSNP, what we've learned as we've built out\nthe protocol, and where we're going]\n\nThis is the first in a series of posts laying out what we have learned in the\nchain search and concepts that are needed to understand where we are going.

Up\nfirst? A look back at the problems we’ve encountered and how our needs were\nmismatched with what was available.\n\nIn 2020, we released the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP)\nWhitepaper [https://github.com/LibertyDSNP/papers]. Since then we have been\nworking to make that protocol a reality. We started with a proof of concept on\nEthereum with version 1.0 of the specification. Although Ethereum has issues\nsuch as cost and possible transactions per second (TPS), it is a great ecosystem\nof developers, knowledge, and tools. We used Ethereum as a testing ground\nknowing that we would need to move to a different chain eventually.\n\nAlong the way we refined the ideas from the whitepaper and tried to focus on the\nreality of what is possible. Several times we questioned the core reasons we\nwanted to use the blockchain in the first place. Each time finding alignment in\nour principle of having the users control their own data and identity. Users\nshould be the ultimate power holders in this new ecosystem.\n\nIn addition to being the shiny new toy in the bin, blockchains provide real\nvalue through a system enabling user ownership, choice, provider cooperation,\nand collaboration in ways previously difficult or impossible. Achieving user\nownership in technology has historically required highly technical\nparticipation, if allowed at all. Anyone can, in theory, physically run a\nserver, but in practice that means technically inclined individuals of means. We\nwant to follow the trend of expanding participation and access, not reverse it.\nBlockchains provide a foundation for ownership without the need for equipment.\n\nOwnership and Choice\n\nOwnership is fundamentally about the ability to choose. Choose who you want to\ninteract with and who you trust. When users are the product and only have the\npower to leave at the cost of forfeiting all they have built on a platform—trust\nis replaced with lock-in. Blockchain elevates and expands the options for\nparticipation in how the network functions and provides for innovation beyond\nwalled off APIs. In addition, we gain benefits from the systems of cryptography,\ndecentralization, economic incentives, and more.\n\nThese qualities encouraged us to find a blockchain that could be the foundation\nfor DSNP. We looked at dozens of chains\n[https://forums.projectliberty.io/t/chain-selection-update-jan-2022/168]. We had\nvarious evaluation criteria to try to weigh the different tradeoffs, but three\ninterconnected issues were above all the others: Low cost, scale, and\ndecentralized disinterested nodes.\n\nLow Cost\n\nLow cost is a bit of a holy grail for blockchain. Every new chain claims\nadvances in transaction price reduction. However, as the chain becomes popular\nthe transaction cost in fiat terms will skyrocket. While some of the value is\nspeculation, a portion is also due to the increasing use and recognition of the\nusefulness of blockchain. That same volatile rise in value leads to\nunpredictable costs which limit the ability for many services to build on top of\nblockchain, especially at scale. How can we convince users and services to adopt\nthe DSNP if the cost of using the protocol fluctuates from next to nothing to\ntens of dollars per chain transaction?\n\nScale\n\nScaled blockchains have been making strides with some chains passing hundreds of\nthousands of transactions per second. Yet, the scale of social media\ninteractions when you include posts, replies, reactions, direct messages, and\nmore is orders of magnitude greater. DSNP leverages a batching concept for\ncompressing the vast number of these messages from a protocol standpoint, but\nthe scale is still beyond what many blockchains are able to do in addition to\ntheir existing growth and load.\n\nDecentralized Nodes\n\nScale aside, some blockchains we looked at have reduced cost by increasing\ncentralization. While we expect chains to go through a period of centralization\nduring testing and early adoption, disinterested nodes are critical for\nmaintaining user ownership when forces collude. For DSNP to remain an open\nprotocol, decentralization of the infrastructure is key to provide guarantees\nagainst powerful bad actors. Social media is targeted by a wide variety of\nactors who desire to control the flow of information. China’s “Great Firewall”\nis the best known, but most political powers have tried with various degrees of\nsuccess to control the flow of information for good and ill. In the end,\ninfrastructure is not a moral agent and cannot not be required to make moral\nchoices. Infrastructure should enable moral decisions to be made by users,\nservice providers, and democratic governance. (Look for more on DSNP governance\nin a future post.)\n\nTrade-offs\n\nCost, scale, and decentralization are the largest requirements for a blockchain\nto support DSNP. We also found a secondary tier of competing trade-offs while\ninvestigating potential chains. Each blockchain comes with its unique spectrum\nof solutions to the problems facing all blockchain projects.\n\n * What is the transaction load that the chain can support?\n * What happens when the chain is under congestion?\n * How can we support shifting network costs from users to services without\n   losing user ownership?\n * What are the data storage and availability guarantees?\n * How can we support upgrades and improvements over time?\n * What are the protections against spam and network abuse?\n * Is the economic system of incentives able to support growth, contraction, and\n   steady state situations?\n * Is the development of the project secure to continue?\n * What outside incentives and pressures might the project have?\n * How hard is it for developers to onboard to build a larger ecosystem?\n\nThe Perfect Chain\n\nAs we tried to answer these questions and more, something kept bothering us. We\nfelt stuck in a blockchain version of Goldilocks and the Three Bears, except\nwith a lot more bears and no bed that matched our needs. Some chains appeared\ngreat, but then as we looked closer, the price might shoot out of our\nconstraints. Others proclaimed decentralization, but were actually dangerously\ncontrolled by a few parties.\n\nDuring the process, we realized that almost every chain we looked at was focused\non the value of each individual transaction. In DSNP, as with networking in\ngeneral, the value is not in the individual messages, but in the aggregate of a\nscaled number of messages and the possibilities of potential connections that\ncreates value.\n\nAnother realization was that our messages on DSNP have different constraints\nthan financial transactions. For DSNP, as other networking protocols like\nTCP/IP, the messages are being created not value transferred. For a new blog\npost, no balance needs to be validated before it can be created. An act of\ncreation is fundamentally different from an act of transfer.\n\nAs we understood these constraints and tradeoffs, an outline emerged of a chain\nperfectly designed for DSNP (or other protocols with similar needs) could look\nlike:\n\n * Decentralized disinterested nodes\n * Scaled messaging with origin validation\n * Predictable costs for users and services\n * Extremely low cost on a per message basis with either support for coinless\n   transactions for users or cost shifting from users to intermediary service\n   providers\n\nThe world is different from 2013 when Vitalik Buterin expanded on the ideas\nproven at scale in Bitcoin. We stand on the work of countless developers today.\nWe believe we can solve the next set of problems to build a blockchain that\nprovides scalable message passing at minimal cost. A chain that can be a\nbackbone of new shared protocols. A world that expands on the ideals of the\nInternet to create value through cooperation and user choice.","html":"<p>[Ed Note: Check out the <a href=\"https://forums.projectliberty.io/t/about-the-concept-posts-category/203\">DSNP Forum</a> to follow community discussions around this new series of short essays that describe some of the concepts behind DSNP, what we've learned as we've built out the protocol, and where we're going]<br><br>This is the first in a series of posts laying out what we have learned in the chain search and concepts that are needed to understand where we are going.
