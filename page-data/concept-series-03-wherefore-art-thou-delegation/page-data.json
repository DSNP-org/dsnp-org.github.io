The applications\nthat are built on top of blockchain have high-friction, user-unfriendly\ninterfaces, requiring one to understand, in the crypto world, what a “wallet”\nis, what it means to “sign” something, and to know to back up your “keys” in a\nsafe place or else you will never get your cryptos back. What even is a\n“custodied wallet” and why should I care what kind of wallet I have?\n\nA: It doesn’t.\nEnd users don’t know how HTTP works, and they don’t need to know. Most people\ncouldn’t name even two types of internet-based protocols. They just want to use\nthe web, and we don’t blame them. It’s not their job! People shouldn’t have to\nadapt to computers; we developers need to make computers adapt to people.\n\nAt the moment, people using decentralized applications, dApps, need to know at\nleast a little bit about cryptography and cryptocurrency to know how to use them\nand use them securely. This shouldn’t be necessary. It’s not reasonable to\nexpect anyone but enthusiasts to learn these things.\n\nWhat happens when these things are too difficult or annoying to deal with? One\nresult is people just write all their passwords on post-it notes, or they come\nup with something short and use it everywhere. People also just avoid things\nthat are difficult and annoying. . . unless, of course, they’re coerced because\notherwise they’ll lose all their social connections. We want people to use DSNP.\nWe also want people to want to use DSNP.\n\nQ: Why should I Have To Pay With My Data To Use a Social Network?\nOne can’t get something for nothing; it’s the first law of thermodynamics. All\nkidding aside, someone has to pay to keep the computers turned on and to build\nthe web applications. Who’s paying for all that, if the users aren’t?\n\nA: You Shouldn’t.\nOne option would be to charge people directly, but making people pay that way\nexcludes a lot of people; not just people who can’t afford it, but lots of\npeople don’t have formal payment methods with which to pay for a social network.\n\nMoney isn’t the only way to pay for things. Some platforms decided that the way\nto pay to keep their lights on – and make a killing too – is by exploiting their\nuser base. Since users aren’t directly paying for access to the platforms, the\nplatforms mine and sell user data, sell and serve people ads, which might have\nbeen okay, sort of, but then they’ve also coerced everyone to stay on their\nplatform. They’ve convinced hundreds of millions of people to join it, while\nmaking it impossible to switch to another without losing all their social and\nfamily connections, without losing access to their favorite artists, to\nteachers, to their clubs, to learn of events they care about. Now the platform\nhas isolated its users from other platforms that might treat them better, it’s\nfree to treat users almost however they want.\n\nAs a result, someone like Kim Kardashian, with 20 million followers, can’t\nafford to leave Instagram. Instagram has managed to successfully coerce a\nbillionaire. If Meta can coerce a billionaire to stay on their platforms, what\nhope do the rest of us have? Don’t you want to keep looking at photos of your\ngrandkids?\n\nWe think this shouldn’t be. Social media is a digital town square, and things\nlike this ought to be built to serve the greater good and not only be accessible\nto every person, but accessible to every application that wants to compete. When\na platform is freely accessible and open source, everyone can benefit. A network\nthat is based on cooperation among end users and applications, where\napplications are competing with each other on how well they serve their users,\nis a threat only to applications that abuse them.\n\nQ: Okay, who provides the resources to fund the platform?\nA: The people running the platform.\nIf people won’t or can’t pay with money, then the people running the platform\nand those developing applications for the platform must be able to shoulder the\nburden of directly paying for the network just like they do now for operating\ncosts.\n\nQ: What do they get out of it?\nA: The short answer is, access to you and your data…but wait!\nWe said you can’t get something for nothing. We said there are ways to pay for\nthings besides money. What we will never say is that you the End User ought to\nbe coerced and exploited for it. We not only think that’s not necessary, but\nit’s bad for people. If you’re doing the work of spending time curating your\nfeed, selecting your friends, following artists, organizations, publications and\ntopics you care about, and if you’re putting your eyeballs on the platforms’\npages looking at their ads, playing their games, and filling out their surveys,\nthen you certainly ought to know and be able to control who’s watching you back,\nwhat they know, and go elsewhere if you want to - for any or no reason.\n\nYou and the application developer have a relationship. Relationships should be\nopt-in and mutually agreed-upon, where neither side is coerced into keeping it.\n\nQ: How do providers fund the platform?\nWe’ve determined that:\n\n * We need a blockchain\n   [https://forums.projectliberty.io/t/concept-series-01-the-problems/193] to\n   store a minimal record of users’ presence.\n * Doing things on a blockchain costs money.\n * Users shouldn’t and often can’t pay directly for access to social networks.\n * People shouldn’t have to be proficient at cryptocurrencies or be security\n   experts.\n * People deserve to control who’s manipulating their own data and what is being\n   done with it.\n\nA: Delegation.\nThe way to shift the costs for “doing things on a blockchain” away from End\nUsers is to delegate the actions to a third party, a Delegate. That Delegate\ncould be running a social network application that you want to use. There are\nother possibilities for delegation on this network, such as content-filtering\nservices that verify other services. So a Delegate’s job is to interact with the\nblockchain on your behalf, and with your explicit permission.\n\nThe fact that the underlying technology is a blockchain shouldn’t get in your\nway, just as you shouldn’t have to figure out how your HTTPS requests are routed\nto each endpoint in order to surf the web. People’s time is valuable and we have\nmachines for that. The Delegate does that kind of lifting so you can focus on\ndoing human things, like chatting with friends, signing up for events, and\ngetting annoyed at your cousin’s excessive travel photos.\n\nDelegates must be associated with their actions on-chain so that others can\ncheck the interactions, but they can also provide services away from the\nblockchain, such as content hosting or wallet recovery. Password managers exist\nfor a reason, and we want to raise the baseline security for everyone while\nstill enabling stronger security measures for those who need or want it.\n\nMost importantly, your data belongs to you. You should be allowed to retract\npermission to that Delegate to do things for you, at any time, without losing\nyour access to the entire platform or your social connections. Having this\ncontrol means you must explicitly authorize your Delegate, and you must know up\nfront what actions they are delegating.\n\nIn short, the relationship must be mutual, trusted and transparent.\n\nWhat things do you imagine a Delegate could do for you? What sorts of companies\nwould you trust to be a delegate? Let’s continue to explore how this concept\nplays out in real life together.","html":"<h1 id=\"why-delegation\">Why Delegation?</h1><p>Once we arrived at “blockchain” as a base technology for a decentralized social network platform, we had to figure out how to get people on it.</p><p>Blockchain technology itself has a stained reputation and many people, if they have any idea what it actually is, are put off by it for a number of reasons, among them:</p><ul><li>It’s new and complicated,</li><li>People have lost a lot of money from it,</li><li>Two words: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Silk Road</a>.</li></ul><h2 id=\"q-why-does-everything-have-to-be-so-hard\">Q: Why Does Everything Have to Be So Hard?</h2><p>Most people think only of NFTs, cryptocurrency and the like.
