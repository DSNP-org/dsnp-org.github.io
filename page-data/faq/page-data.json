While users are free to choose their server operator initially, once registered with a given server, the user's data, including content and social graph, is under the control of that server's management. Users are free to leave if they don't like a server's management or policies, but they can't take their data with them when they go. In effect, their online life is not under their control.</p><p>By storing user's social graph and activity on the blockchain, the DSNP guarantees that users are not beholden to anyone, and if they take issue with their social provider, they can always move to another with the assurance that all their friends, settings and content will come with them.
