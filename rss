Once we arrived at “blockchain” as a base technology for a decentralized social
network platform, we had to figure out how to get people on it.

Blockchain technology itself has a stained reputation and many people, if they
have any idea what it actually is, are put off by it for a number of reasons,
among them:

 * It’s new and complicated,
 * People have lost a lot of money from it,

The applications that are built on top of blockchain have high-friction, user-unfriendly interfaces, requiring one to understand, in the crypto world, what a “wallet” is, what it means to “sign” something, and to know to back up your “keys” in a safe place or else you will never get your cryptos back. What even is a “custodied wallet” and why should I care what kind of wallet I have?</p><h2 id="a-it-doesn%E2%80%99t">A: It doesn’t.</h2><p>End users don’t know how HTTP works, and they don’t need to know. Most people couldn’t name even two types of internet-based protocols. They just want to use the web, and we don’t blame them. It’s not their job! People shouldn’t have to adapt to computers; we developers need to make computers adapt to people.</p><p>At the moment, people using decentralized applications, dApps, need to know at least a little bit about cryptography and cryptocurrency to know how to use them and use them securely. This shouldn’t be necessary. It’s not reasonable to expect anyone but enthusiasts to learn these things.</p><p>What happens when these things are too difficult or annoying to deal with? One result is people just write all their passwords on post-it notes, or they come up with something short and use it everywhere. People also just avoid things that are difficult and annoying. . . unless, of course, they’re coerced because otherwise they’ll lose all their social connections. We want people to use DSNP. We also want people to want to use DSNP.</p><h2 id="q-why-should-i-have-to-pay-with-my-data-to-use-a-social-network">Q: Why should I Have To Pay With My Data To Use a Social Network?</h2><p>One can’t get something for nothing; it’s the first law of thermodynamics. All kidding aside, someone has to pay to keep the computers turned on and to build the web applications. Who’s paying for all that, if the users aren’t?</p><h2 id="a-you-shouldn%E2%80%99t">A: You Shouldn’t.</h2><p>One option would be to charge people directly, but making people pay that way excludes a lot of people; not just people who can’t afford it, but lots of people don’t have formal payment methods with which to pay for a social network.</p><p>Money isn’t the only way to pay for things. Some platforms decided that the way to pay to keep their lights on – and make a killing too – is by exploiting their user base. Since users aren’t directly paying for access to the platforms, the platforms mine and sell user data, sell and serve people ads, which might have been okay, sort of, but then they’ve also coerced everyone to stay on their platform. They’ve convinced hundreds of millions of people to join it, while making it impossible to switch to another without losing all their social and family connections, without losing access to their favorite artists, to teachers, to their clubs, to learn of events they care about. Now the platform has isolated its users from other platforms that might treat them better, it’s free to treat users almost however they want.</p><p>As a result, someone like Kim Kardashian, with 20 million followers, can’t afford to leave Instagram. Instagram has managed to successfully coerce a billionaire. If Meta can coerce a billionaire to stay on their platforms, what hope do the rest of us have? Don’t you want to keep looking at photos of your grandkids?</p><p>We think this shouldn’t be. Social media is a digital town square, and things like this ought to be built to serve the greater good and not only be accessible to every person, but accessible to every application that wants to compete. When a platform is freely accessible and open source, everyone can benefit. A network that is based on cooperation among end users and applications, where applications are competing with each other on how well they serve their users, is a threat only to applications that abuse them.</p><h2 id="q-okay-who-provides-the-resources-to-fund-the-platform">Q: Okay, who provides the resources to fund the platform?</h2><h2 id="a-the-people-running-the-platform">A: The people running the platform.</h2><p>If people won’t or can’t pay with money, then the people running the platform and those developing applications for the platform must be able to shoulder the burden of directly paying for the network just like they do now for operating costs.</p><h2 id="q-what-do-they-get-out-of-it">Q: What do they get out of it?</h2><h2 id="a-the-short-answer-is-access-to-you-and-your-data%E2%80%A6but-wait">A: The short answer is, access to you and your data…but wait!</h2><p>We said you can’t get something for nothing. We said there are ways to pay for things besides money. What we will <em>never</em> say is that you the End User ought to be coerced and exploited for it. We not only think that’s not necessary, but it’s bad for people. If you’re doing the work of spending time curating your feed, selecting your friends, following artists, organizations, publications and topics you care about, and if you’re putting your eyeballs on the platforms’ pages looking at their ads, playing their games, and filling out their surveys, then you certainly ought to know and be able to control who’s watching you back, what they know, and go elsewhere if you want to - for any or no reason.</p><p>You and the application developer have a relationship. Relationships should be opt-in and mutually agreed-upon, where neither side is coerced into keeping it.</p><h2 id="q-how-do-providers-fund-the-platform">Q: How do providers fund the platform?</h2><p>We’ve determined that:</p><ul><li>We <a href="https://forums.projectliberty.io/t/concept-series-01-the-problems/193">need a blockchain</a> to store a minimal record of users’ presence.</li><li>Doing things on a blockchain costs money.</li><li>Users shouldn’t and often can’t pay directly for access to social networks.</li><li>People shouldn’t have to be proficient at cryptocurrencies or be security experts.</li><li>People deserve to control who’s manipulating their own data and what is being done with it.</li></ul><h2 id="a-delegation">A: Delegation.</h2><p>The way to shift the costs for “doing things on a blockchain” away from End Users is to delegate the actions to a third party, a Delegate. That Delegate could be running a social network application that you want to use. There are other possibilities for delegation on this network, such as content-filtering services that verify other services. So a Delegate’s job is to interact with the blockchain on your behalf, and with your explicit permission.</p><p>The fact that the underlying technology is a blockchain shouldn’t get in your way, just as you shouldn’t have to figure out how your HTTPS requests are routed to each endpoint in order to surf the web. People’s time is valuable and we have machines for that. The Delegate does that kind of lifting so you can focus on doing human things, like chatting with friends, signing up for events, and getting annoyed at your cousin’s excessive travel photos.</p><p>Delegates must be associated with their actions on-chain so that others can check the interactions, but they can also provide services away from the blockchain, such as content hosting or wallet recovery. Password managers exist for a reason, and we want to raise the baseline security for everyone while still enabling stronger security measures for those who need or want it.</p><p>Most importantly, your data belongs to you. You should be allowed to retract permission to that Delegate to do things for you, at any time, without losing your access to the entire platform or your social connections. Having this control means you must explicitly authorize your Delegate, and you must know up front what actions they are delegating.</p><p>In short, the relationship must be mutual, trusted and transparent.</p><p>What things do you imagine a Delegate could do for you? What sorts of companies would you trust to be a delegate? Let’s continue to explore how this concept plays out in real life together.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Concept Series 02: Source-Dependent Messages]]></title><description><![CDATA[[Ed Note: Check out the DSNP Forum

(Read the previous post on our Forum at <a href="https://forums.projectliberty.io/t/concept-series-01-the-problems/193">Concept Series 01: The Problems</a>.)</p><p>Each time you tell the world that something exists, it creates a narrative that forms your identity. In a more technical definition, an identity is a construct formed by the aggregation of events from the same source. Each event or message is therefore source-dependent as messages without a source do not build an identity.</p><p><strong>Transfers</strong></p><p>Most blockchain projects have focused on the concept of transfer. They have worked toward the questions around transfers: How can it be easier to transfer value from one user to another? How can these transfers be controlled programmatically? And even how can we create new unique items of value to transfer to others? The advances in answers have led down a path that has particular constraints.</p><p>Transfer centric transactions require protecting against attacks such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">double-spend attack</a>. A transfer requires confirmation of ownership before that ownership can be transferred. This means that transfer transactions must be well ordered, have a higher level of validation and security, and can only be processed in series or other guarantees against interactions with other transactions.</p><p><strong>Source-Dependent Creation</strong></p><p>Social networking is a world not dependent on transferring value. Each piece of the narrative that creates the identity is starting fresh from the source. Other data in social networks may then refer to the content, but do not alter it. The only requirement is that each new creation is able to be linked to the creator.</p><p>Scientific data, supply chain checkpoints, and more share the characteristic that they need proof of who sent the message, but do not need any proof of transfer. This is the idea of an audit. We can follow the trail of who said what when and discover any falsehoods. Trust, but verify.</p><p>How does that verification happen? The simplest version of source validation is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">cryptographic signature</a>. Mathematical proof that only the holder of a private key could have signed the message. We can extend the capabilities of a signature through a secure blockchain state that links public keys together (our next concept post). The key is that the validation be easy and quick. Fast validation allows for invalid signatures and messages to be rejected quickly with no chance of being mistaken for an original. Once we focus on the source validation requirement, we can create two new features not possible in a traditional blockchain transfer transaction: off-chain validation and parallel processing.</p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><p>Any action on-chain is expensive. Each action must be performed, replicated, and confirmed by consensus. The result of those actions is guaranteed with the highest possible trust level available to the chain. The cost for that guarantee is usually high and borne by the sender of the transaction. Off-chain actions have a different cost profile. The action must be done for each consumer of the transaction. This shifts the cost from the creator of the transaction to the consumer, from writing to reading. That shift is desirable when the primary value is in the consumption instead of the publication of the data.</p><p>Our source-dependent messages don’t require a prior validation of chain state to exist. We can use the chain for propagation and existence of the message and move the validation of the message source or creator off-chain. To make the cost of validation low, we use the chain to provide easy access to the necessary data for validation. We get what is called in computer science a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">lazy evaluation 1</a>” of message validity. Consumers desire valid messages and the low-cost means that producers of messages can expect that invalid messages will be discovered.</p><p>Source-dependent messages are parallelizable by default. Parallel processing of transactions is often seen as a holy grail of blockchain technology due to the potential performance improvements. Source-dependent messages do require some previous state, the ability to know they are sourced correctly, but that is a far more limited need (and off-chain possible).</p><p><strong>Problems: Race Conditions and Revocation</strong></p><p>Of course, there are some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">race conditions</a> (isn’t there always?). A source-dependent message must be preceded by data needed to confirm the source. Cryptographic signatures do provide us a way to confirm the source is the holder of a private key, but nothing beyond that. If the source is not merely a public key, the identifier used must be associated with a public key before the message can be tested or an invalid message would occur pending the proper association.</p><p>Those familiar with signatures will already know the next problem: revocation. Best security practices encourage rotating keys from time to time so that if a private key is exposed, the damage can be limited. We must deal with how to remove a key from the identifier aka revocation of the permissions of a key to be a future source of messages. Users may also need to revoke or change a message after it is created.</p><p><strong>Solving the Problems</strong></p><p>We can solve the problems with applying a two layer approach to message validation. First, we check if the message has a valid source. This is based only on data available at the time the message was sent. Because the historical data doesn’t change, the result is immutable and can be cached indefinitely. A message with a valid source can never in the future be considered to have an invalid source.</p><p>The second layer is more difficult because we need the ability to change the validity of messages in the future. Users, services, and others need to delete messages that were unintended or where a permission was abused. In DSNP, we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombstone_(data_store)" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Tombstoning</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">idempotent</a> state changes to accomplish. Tombstoning is a revocation of a previous announcement. It says that while that announcement did exist, you should consider it to not exist anymore. Idempotent state changes don’t remove a previous message, but shift the state to a different value. <a href="https://spec.dsnp.org/DSNP/Types/GraphChange" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Graph change announcements</a> shift the state of a graph connection from unfollowed to followed.</p><p>However it is done, the message or state is altered by a future message. It is a much more difficult search space as it is continuously expanding. Because some use cases may desire just the immutable message, the second layer of future revocation need not always be available, but it should always be considered. While computers might not, humans change their minds all the time and DSNP is a tool for human communication.</p><p>As we continue this series of concepts, the idea of source-dependent messages, these creation focused messages, leads to more building blocks. Next in the series, we explore how we can leverage the limited requirements and ability for off-chain validation to enable scaled batching through user delegation of trust.</p><p>Next Concept Series 03: Batching Source-Dependent Messages with Delegation (coming soon…)</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Concept Series 01: The Problems]]></title><description><![CDATA[[Ed Note: Check out the DSNP Forum

Up first? A look back at the problems we’ve encountered and how our needs were mismatched with what was available.</br></br></p><p>In 2020, we released the <a href="https://github.com/LibertyDSNP/papers">Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP) Whitepaper</a>. Since then we have been working to make that protocol a reality. We started with a proof of concept on Ethereum with version 1.0 of the specification. Although Ethereum has issues such as cost and possible transactions per second (TPS), it is a great ecosystem of developers, knowledge, and tools. We used Ethereum as a testing ground knowing that we would need to move to a different chain eventually.</p><p>Along the way we refined the ideas from the whitepaper and tried to focus on the reality of what is possible. Several times we questioned the core reasons we wanted to use the blockchain in the first place. Each time finding alignment in our principle of having the users control their own data and identity. Users should be the ultimate power holders in this new ecosystem.</p><p>In addition to being the shiny new toy in the bin, blockchains provide real value through a system enabling user ownership, choice, provider cooperation, and collaboration in ways previously difficult or impossible. Achieving user ownership in technology has historically required highly technical participation, if allowed at all. Anyone can, in theory, physically run a server, but in practice that means technically inclined individuals of means. We want to follow the trend of expanding participation and access, not reverse it. Blockchains provide a foundation for ownership without the need for equipment.</p><p><strong>Ownership and Choice</strong></p><p>Ownership is fundamentally about the ability to choose. Choose who you want to interact with and who you trust. When users are the product and only have the power to leave at the cost of forfeiting all they have built on a platform—trust is replaced with lock-in. Blockchain elevates and expands the options for participation in how the network functions and provides for innovation beyond walled off APIs. In addition, we gain benefits from the systems of cryptography, decentralization, economic incentives, and more.</p><p>These qualities encouraged us to find a blockchain that could be the foundation for DSNP. We looked at <a href="https://forums.projectliberty.io/t/chain-selection-update-jan-2022/168">dozens of chains</a>. We had various evaluation criteria to try to weigh the different tradeoffs, but three interconnected issues were above all the others: Low cost, scale, and decentralized disinterested nodes.</p><p><strong>Low Cost</strong></p><p>Low cost is a bit of a holy grail for blockchain. Every new chain claims advances in transaction price reduction. However, as the chain becomes popular the transaction cost in fiat terms will skyrocket. While some of the value is speculation, a portion is also due to the increasing use and recognition of the usefulness of blockchain. That same volatile rise in value leads to unpredictable costs which limit the ability for many services to build on top of blockchain, especially at scale. How can we convince users and services to adopt the DSNP if the cost of using the protocol fluctuates from next to nothing to tens of dollars per chain transaction?</p><p><strong>Scale</strong></p><p>Scaled blockchains have been making strides with some chains passing hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. Yet, the scale of social media interactions when you include posts, replies, reactions, direct messages, and more is orders of magnitude greater. DSNP leverages a batching concept for compressing the vast number of these messages from a protocol standpoint, but the scale is still beyond what many blockchains are able to do in addition to their existing growth and load.</p><p><strong>Decentralized Nodes</strong></p><p>Scale aside, some blockchains we looked at have reduced cost by increasing centralization. While we expect chains to go through a period of centralization during testing and early adoption, disinterested nodes are critical for maintaining user ownership when forces collude. For DSNP to remain an open protocol, decentralization of the infrastructure is key to provide guarantees against powerful bad actors. Social media is targeted by a wide variety of actors who desire to control the flow of information. China’s “Great Firewall” is the best known, but most political powers have tried with various degrees of success to control the flow of information for good and ill. In the end, infrastructure is not a moral agent and cannot not be required to make moral choices. Infrastructure should enable moral decisions to be made by users, service providers, and democratic governance. (Look for more on DSNP governance in a future post.)</p><p><strong>Trade-offs</strong></p><p>Cost, scale, and decentralization are the largest requirements for a blockchain to support DSNP. We also found a secondary tier of competing trade-offs while investigating potential chains. Each blockchain comes with its unique spectrum of solutions to the problems facing all blockchain projects.</p><ul><li>What is the transaction load that the chain can support?</li><li>What happens when the chain is under congestion?</li><li>How can we support shifting network costs from users to services without losing user ownership?</li><li>What are the data storage and availability guarantees?</li><li>How can we support upgrades and improvements over time?</li><li>What are the protections against spam and network abuse?</li><li>Is the economic system of incentives able to support growth, contraction, and steady state situations?</li><li>Is the development of the project secure to continue?</li><li>What outside incentives and pressures might the project have?</li><li>How hard is it for developers to onboard to build a larger ecosystem?</li></ul><p><strong>The Perfect Chain</strong></p><p>As we tried to answer these questions and more, something kept bothering us. We felt stuck in a blockchain version of Goldilocks and the Three Bears, except with a lot more bears and no bed that matched our needs. Some chains appeared great, but then as we looked closer, the price might shoot out of our constraints. Others proclaimed decentralization, but were actually dangerously controlled by a few parties.</p><p>During the process, we realized that almost every chain we looked at was focused on the value of each individual transaction. In DSNP, as with networking in general, the value is not in the individual messages, but in the aggregate of a scaled number of messages and the possibilities of potential connections that creates value.</p><p>Another realization was that our messages on DSNP have different constraints than financial transactions. For DSNP, as other networking protocols like TCP/IP, the messages are being created not value transferred. For a new blog post, no balance needs to be validated before it can be created. An act of creation is fundamentally different from an act of transfer.</p><p>As we understood these constraints and tradeoffs, an outline emerged of a chain perfectly designed for DSNP (or other protocols with similar needs) could look like:</p><ul><li>Decentralized disinterested nodes</li><li>Scaled messaging with origin validation</li><li>Predictable costs for users and services</li><li>Extremely low cost on a per message basis with either support for coinless transactions for users or cost shifting from users to intermediary service providers</li></ul><p>The world is different from 2013 when Vitalik Buterin expanded on the ideas proven at scale in Bitcoin. We stand on the work of countless developers today. We believe we can solve the next set of problems to build a blockchain that provides scalable message passing at minimal cost. A chain that can be a backbone of new shared protocols. A world that expands on the ideals of the Internet to create value through cooperation and user choice.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[DSNP Update: March 2022]]></title><description><![CDATA[In March, our contributors continued to build out our collaboration

Today, social graphs are owned by private companies and each platform has their own. The social graph is immensely powerful, because so much of how we connect, learn, transact, contribute, and consume travels over the circuitry. So private companies who own our social graph have essentially become gatekeepers of our interactions. They broker our relationships, they get all the value of our personal data, they surveil us, and they use that data too. And they have control over the information we see.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/563863925?app_id=122963" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" title="What is a shared social graph?"/></figure><h3 id="q-who-should-own-the-social-graph">Q: Who should own the social graph?</h3><p>A: We believe the social graph should not be private company property. It should belong to everyone as basic public infrastructure. When the social graph is unified, shared, and open, we have a path to making it better for all of us. We can have one social graph underlying many apps built by many people and many different sizes of companies or entrepreneurs. This new social graph belongs to the public and is decentralized, meaning it's not under corporate control, and instead is managed by the entire global community that uses it, like the web. This is also critical to making it work better for all of us. Standards organizations have done this for a long time with the web's core protocols, and the social graph can work the same way.</p><p>We can embed civic values into the core protocol, and embed individual data rights by default. For example, we can ensure that the person who's using an app that's built on the social graph owns their data. Instead of a company owning it, the person controls their data and how it's used. We can establish a foundation that makes it possible for the value from the use of that data to flow directly to the person who contributed it. With this new model, we can design using the knowledge of what went wrong in the past so we can all work together to build better.</p><h3 id="q-what-do-you-hope-the-world-would-be-like-with-a-shared-social-graph"><strong>Q: What do you hope the world would be like with a shared social graph?</strong></h3><p>A: We all get that social networks are powerful, but it's harder for us all to see how proprietary walled gardens have limited what we can do with our social networks. We've been limited by a very narrow interpretation of what's possible. The options that are open to us are limited to the use cases that best drive profit for large companies. We've actually seen very little of what we can do with our social networks. How could we collaborate better? What kind of new commerce could we open up? We're limited today by the interpretations of just a handful of companies. For thousands of years, we've come together in towns and cities to drive social and economic benefit by working together. What would happen if the way we come together today, which is digitally and at massive scale, could be supported by a new digital civic architecture instead of run by a private company? What could this unlock?</p><p>There is immense power in our social networks, so by taking the social graph back, we open the opportunity to connect the power of our social networks together to drive change. We're relying on large private companies to fix the problems we're facing with social media, but their incentives are to drive profit, not to strengthen our social civic fabric. So, by creating a new model and a new foundation, we unlock an alternate digital future, fueled by open architecture and community governance. And we open the chance to bring together all the best thinkers, no matter where they are, to discover new ways to make things better.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Our Misson]]></title><description><![CDATA[The mission of DSNP.org is to support community development of open source

Because the protocol is available for anyone to use, for both commercial and non-commercial purposes, our role is to help implementors ensure the integrity and decentralized governance of the unified and universally accessible social graph. The integrity of the graph includes DSNP's promises about people's privacy and control over their communications.  To serve these goals:</p><ul><li>We provide a framework for DSNP-related working groups and ongoing standards development (based loosely on the role of the IETF in Internet governance), and help participants interface with other standards bodies when needed.</li><li>We keep watch for unanticipated or adversarial centralization, and coordinate community response as needed. Decentralized systems usually have centralizing forces circulating within them, for example nodes that grow especially large and influential, and preserving true decentralization can sometimes require coordinated action.</li><li>We arrange virtual and in-person gatherings of DSNP implementors, both to help accelerate development and usage of DSNP as a technology and to ensure that there is a community of mutually familiar implementors who share a vision of DSNP's purpose.</li><li>We coordinate legal defense of DSNP if necessary (e.g., community patent defense).</li><li>We work transparently and in public as much as possible.  Anyone should be able to see what what DSNP.org is doing without necessarily being a participant.</li></ul><p>Control of content flowing over DSNP is not within the scope of DSNP.org's mission, and we do not take part in development of content filtering policy; that is for nodes in and gateways to the graph to decide and implement.  Our goal is maintenance of the protocol and the decentralized social graph in such a way that the public interest is well-served by having individuals use DSNP-based technologies to communicate.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[DSNP Update: June 2021]]></title><description><![CDATA[Last month, our contributors met a huge milestone — we’ve delivered the first usable releases of the contracts and SDK.

They’ve controlled innovation. They’ve controlled how value flows. This control starts with ownership of the social graph—the digital representation of our online relationships that governs how we connect, contribute, and consume. We believe the social graph should not be the property of companies—it should belong to everyone. It should be basic public infrastructure, like the core protocols that drive the web itself. We’ve developed an open source, unified social graph that opens the path to reclaim our networks. It’s called the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP), and it’s designed to transform the social graph from a corporate asset to community-governed public infrastructure.

While users are free to choose their server operator initially, once registered with a given server, the user's data, including content and social graph, is under the control of that server's management. Users are free to leave if they don't like a server's management or policies, but they can't take their data with them when they go. In effect, their online life is not under their control.</p><p>By storing user's social graph and activity on the blockchain, the DSNP guarantees that users are not beholden to anyone, and if they take issue with their social provider, they can always move to another with the assurance that all their friends, settings and content will come with them. They could even use multiple providers at once for different purposes and feature sets.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Are you building a Facebook-killer?]]></title><description><![CDATA[No. We're building the low-level infrastructure that will make it easy for apps
