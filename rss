They’ve controlled innovation. They’ve controlled how value flows. This control starts with ownership of the social graph—the digital representation of our online relationships that governs how we connect, contribute, and consume. We believe the social graph should not be the property of companies—it should belong to everyone. It should be basic public infrastructure, like the core protocols that drive the web itself. We’ve developed an open source, unified social graph that opens the path to reclaim our networks. It’s called the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP), and it’s designed to transform the social graph from a corporate asset to community-governed public infrastructure. Everything within this project is open source.</p><p>If this is your first visit, the <a href="https://github.com/LibertyDSNP/papers/blob/main/whitepaper/dsnp_whitepaper.pdf">Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP) whitepaper</a> is a good place to start.

We identified the possibility for just such a model in what may seem an unexpected place: the concept at the core of the social network itself, known as the social graph. The term "social graph" isn't widely known beyond Internet technology circles, but it is a digital representation of all the relationships between members of a social network. When we use a social network—as nearly 60 percent of the world does—all the ways we connect, learn, transact, consume, and contribute traverse this essential online circuitry. The social graph holds immense power over us all, and the largest social networks are owned and controlled by powerful, private companies, each built on its own proprietary social graph. The key to change lies in the power of combining our social networks in one unified social graph that is free from corporate control and rewards innovators and value creators directly.</p><p>Late in 2019, <a href="https://www.unfinishedlabs.io/">Unfinished Labs</a> assembled a team and began to build that social graph protocol. The Decentralized Social Network Protocol (DSNP) is the result of their work, and DSNP.org is an independent stewardship organization that serves as the home for ongoing development of the DSNP specifications and open source code.</p><p>Opening the social graph for building is only the beginning. To enable a vibrant ecosystem of apps that leverage the new social graph, Unfinished Labs continues to develop essential tooling for rapid testing and launch of new social apps and integration of social features into existing apps.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mission & Activities]]></title><description><![CDATA[The mission of DSNP.org is to support community development of open source

Because the protocol is available for anyone to use, for both commercial and non-commercial purposes, our role is to help implementors ensure the integrity and decentralized governance of the unified and universally accessible social graph. The integrity of the graph includes DSNP's promises about people's privacy and control over their communications.  To serve these goals:</p><ul><li>We provide a framework for DSNP-related working groups and ongoing standards development (based loosely on the role of the IETF in Internet governance), and help participants interface with other standards bodies when needed.</li><li>We keep watch for unanticipated or adversarial centralization, and coordinate community response as needed. Decentralized systems usually have centralizing forces circulating within them, for example nodes that grow especially large and influential, and preserving true decentralization can sometimes require coordinated action.</li><li>We arrange virtual and in-person gatherings of DSNP implementors, both to help accelerate development and usage of DSNP as a technology and to ensure that there is a community of mutually familiar implementors who share a vision of DSNP's purpose.</li><li>We coordinate legal defense of DSNP if necessary (e.g., community patent defense).</li><li>We work transparently and in public as much as possible.  Anyone should be able to see what what DSNP.org is doing without necessarily being a participant.</li></ul><p>Control of content flowing over DSNP is not within the scope of DSNP.org's mission, and we do not take part in development of content filtering policy; that is for nodes in and gateways to the graph to decide and implement.  Our goal is maintenance of the protocol and the decentralized social graph in such a way that the public interest is well-served by having individuals use DSNP-based technologies to communicate.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Guiding Principles]]></title><description><![CDATA[We ground our work in a fairly simple ethos.  We've tried to lay them out here.

While users are free to choose their server operator initially, once registered with a given server, the user's data, including content and social graph, is under the control of that server's management. Users are free to leave if they don't like a server's management or policies, but they can't take their data with them when they go. In effect, their online life is not under their control.</p><p>By storing user's social graph and activity on the blockchain, the DSNP guarantees that users are not beholden to anyone, and if they take issue with their social provider, they can always move to another with the assurance that all their friends, settings and content will come with them. They could even use multiple providers at once for different purposes and feature sets.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Are you building a Facebook-killer?]]></title><description><![CDATA[No. We're building the low-level infrastructure that will make it easy for apps
