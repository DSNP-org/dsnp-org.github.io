Today, social graphs are owned by private companies and each platform has their own. The social graph is immensely powerful, because so much of how we connect, learn, transact, contribute, and consume travels over the circuitry. So private companies who own our social graph have essentially become gatekeepers of our interactions. They broker our relationships, they get all the value of our personal data, they surveil us, and they use that data too. And they have control over the information we see.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/563863925?app_id=122963" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" title="What is a shared social graph?"/></figure><h3 id="q-who-should-own-the-social-graph">Q: Who should own the social graph?</h3><p>A: We believe the social graph should not be private company property. It should belong to everyone as basic public infrastructure. When the social graph is unified, shared, and open, we have a path to making it better for all of us. We can have one social graph underlying many apps built by many people and many different sizes of companies or entrepreneurs. This new social graph belongs to the public and is decentralized, meaning it's not under corporate control, and instead is managed by the entire global community that uses it, like the web. This is also critical to making it work better for all of us. Standards organizations have done this for a long time with the web's core protocols, and the social graph can work the same way.</p><p>We can embed civic values into the core protocol, and embed individual data rights by default. For example, we can ensure that the person who's using an app that's built on the social graph owns their data. Instead of a company owning it, the person controls their data and how it's used. We can establish a foundation that makes it possible for the value from the use of that data to flow directly to the person who contributed it. With this new model, we can design using the knowledge of what went wrong in the past so we can all work together to build better.</p><h3 id="q-what-do-you-hope-the-world-would-be-like-with-a-shared-social-graph"><strong>Q: What do you hope the world would be like with a shared social graph?</strong></h3><p>A: We all get that social networks are powerful, but it's harder for us all to see how proprietary walled gardens have limited what we can do with our social networks. We've been limited by a very narrow interpretation of what's possible. The options that are open to us are limited to the use cases that best drive profit for large companies. We've actually seen very little of what we can do with our social networks. How could we collaborate better? What kind of new commerce could we open up? We're limited today by the interpretations of just a handful of companies. For thousands of years, we've come together in towns and cities to drive social and economic benefit by working together. What would happen if the way we come together today, which is digitally and at massive scale, could be supported by a new digital civic architecture instead of run by a private company? What could this unlock?</p><p>There is immense power in our social networks, so by taking the social graph back, we open the opportunity to connect the power of our social networks together to drive change. We're relying on large private companies to fix the problems we're facing with social media, but their incentives are to drive profit, not to strengthen our social civic fabric. So, by creating a new model and a new foundation, we unlock an alternate digital future, fueled by open architecture and community governance. And we open the chance to bring together all the best thinkers, no matter where they are, to discover new ways to make things better.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Our Misson]]></title><description><![CDATA[The mission of DSNP.org is to support community development of open source

Because the protocol is available for anyone to use, for both commercial and non-commercial purposes, our role is to help implementors ensure the integrity and decentralized governance of the unified and universally accessible social graph. The integrity of the graph includes DSNP's promises about people's privacy and control over their communications.  To serve these goals:</p><ul><li>We provide a framework for DSNP-related working groups and ongoing standards development (based loosely on the role of the IETF in Internet governance), and help participants interface with other standards bodies when needed.</li><li>We keep watch for unanticipated or adversarial centralization, and coordinate community response as needed. Decentralized systems usually have centralizing forces circulating within them, for example nodes that grow especially large and influential, and preserving true decentralization can sometimes require coordinated action.</li><li>We arrange virtual and in-person gatherings of DSNP implementors, both to help accelerate development and usage of DSNP as a technology and to ensure that there is a community of mutually familiar implementors who share a vision of DSNP's purpose.</li><li>We coordinate legal defense of DSNP if necessary (e.g., community patent defense).</li><li>We work transparently and in public as much as possible.  Anyone should be able to see what what DSNP.org is doing without necessarily being a participant.</li></ul><p>Control of content flowing over DSNP is not within the scope of DSNP.org's mission, and we do not take part in development of content filtering policy; that is for nodes in and gateways to the graph to decide and implement.  Our goal is maintenance of the protocol and the decentralized social graph in such a way that the public interest is well-served by having individuals use DSNP-based technologies to communicate.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[DSNP Update: June 2021]]></title><description><![CDATA[Last month, our contributors met a huge milestone — we’ve delivered the first usable releases of the contracts and SDK.

They’ve controlled innovation. They’ve controlled how value flows. This control starts with ownership of the social graph—the digital representation of our online relationships that governs how we connect, contribute, and consume. We believe the social graph should not be the property of companies—it should belong to everyone. It should be basic public infrastructure, like the core protocols that drive the web itself. We’ve developed an open source, unified social graph that opens the path to reclaim our networks. It’s called the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP), and it’s designed to transform the social graph from a corporate asset to community-governed public infrastructure.

While users are free to choose their server operator initially, once registered with a given server, the user's data, including content and social graph, is under the control of that server's management. Users are free to leave if they don't like a server's management or policies, but they can't take their data with them when they go. In effect, their online life is not under their control.</p><p>By storing user's social graph and activity on the blockchain, the DSNP guarantees that users are not beholden to anyone, and if they take issue with their social provider, they can always move to another with the assurance that all their friends, settings and content will come with them.
