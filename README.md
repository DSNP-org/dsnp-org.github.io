# DSNP.org Website Source

The DSNP.org website runs as a static site on GitHub Pages. The static site is built using two open source tools: [Ghost](https://ghost.org) serves as a lightweight CMS, while [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) pulls content from Ghost and generates the static HTML, CSS, and Javascript files and publishes them to GitHub Pages.

There are three main guide documents in this repository:

 * The [Content Management Guide](docs/cms_guide.md) explains how to add or update content in the Ghost CMS.
 * The [Deployment Guide](docs/deploy_guide.md) explains how to deploy updates to GitHub Pages.
 * The [Developer Guide](docs/dev_guide.md) goes into more detail on how to set up development (or production) instances of Ghost and Gatsby.
